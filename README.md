Fairness in AI

1. Bias in Data and Prediction
   Investigation of biases in data and their impact on machine learning models, using the Adult and German Credit datasets. Implementation of statistical parity and equalized opportunity metrics,    preprocessing data, and analyzing biases to understand how protected features like gender and age affect outcomes. Training models to assess prediction fairness and accuracy, and exploring        methods to mitigate bias, such as excluding protected features and using data augmentation, to evaluate their effectiveness in creating fairer models. <br> <br>
